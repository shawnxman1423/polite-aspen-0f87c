      - title: What's Inspro
        content: >+
          Inspro is an **Android** app to help your Instagram account get more
          likes, follows and interactions by automating actions you usually have
          to spend a lot of time doing yourself.

      - title: Is it really free?
        content: >+
          When we say free - we mean it! You don't need to add your credit card
          or any other payment details with us to get started. We hope that
          after you have seen that we really do work, you would like to join us
          and unlock much more powerful capabilities!

      - title: Is Inspro safe?
        content: >
          Definitely! Your account's safety is our top priority. Because Inspro
          runs directly on your smartphone, there is no need to use proxies!
          Also, we keep your account safe and operate within Instagram's
          limitations. We don't deal with fake accounts, meaning we're only
          engaging with real and active users on Instagram. For advanced users
          we allow to modify settings to fit them best.
      - title: Do you support iOS too?
        content: >
          Sadly, we do not support iOS. We only support Android devices because
          in Android we are capable of working around the clock.
      - title: Does Inspro work all the time?
        content: >+
          We make sure Inspro works while you don't.  Inspro does all the hard
          work for you. You'll see your followers and engagement grow without
          having to interact with others manually. We encourage you to keep
          posting great content to speed up your growth. You might notice that
          Inspro is often napping. This is done only to mimic a real human.
