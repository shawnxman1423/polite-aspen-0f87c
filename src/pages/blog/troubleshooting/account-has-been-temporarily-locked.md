So you received the "Your Account Has Been Temporarily Locked"?

Don't worry, this notification is totally normal, it is bound to happen at some point with Inspro. You have not been hacked and you will not get your profile blocked.

This notification is not a warning, block, flag, sanction, or shadowban.

You simply need to follow Instagram instructions.
Once your password is changed you simply need to reconnect your Instagram profile to Inspro and you're good to go!

What you can do to secure your connection, even more, is to open your Instagram App, and then go to Settings > Security > Login Activity > Select This Was Me.

Enabling 2FA will also help prevent this issue.
